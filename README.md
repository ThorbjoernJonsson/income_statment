# income_statment
Import income statements from financialmodelingprep.com

When I'm trying to analyze companies I have realized that I have to spend a lot of time googling to find income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statement.
I found a good webpage that has financial statements in a convenient format, however I just found out that only the first 250 requests are free.
I have included my code but now I'm going to start looking at web scraping to see if I can get it for free.
